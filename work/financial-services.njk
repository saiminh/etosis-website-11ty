    'One of the trading systems split a trade order into a number of smaller orders executed at different times, To optimise the price and to make it less obvious that someone is interested in buying a large number of shares. Very useful for smaller traders, as orders are public record and large traders may benefit from this information by quickly buying those shares.',
    'Another, much more complicated system, looks at long-term changes in the price of related assets and automatically establishes a position in a certain asset if it has become undervalued. Of course, determining what it means to be undervalued is a very difficult thing. Through calling into the clientâ€™s Matlab code for the determination and reimplementing the more successful versions in Java resulted in improved performance and reliability.',
    'Varying greatly in functionality, both need to be extremely reliable, well-tested and fail safely. They need to look at the market as a whole to prevent automated hysteria, for example when the market is extremely volatile. They also need to connect to different trading platforms and pricing information systems with as many APIs.'
