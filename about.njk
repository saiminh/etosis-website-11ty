      <p>
        I have been working as a software developer since 1999. Initially I worked on advertising projects and content management systems as a part-time job during my studies.
      </p><p>
        Later on, I got a part-time job as research assistant during which I worked on embedded systems and security (and ported Emacs to Minix, which will most likely remain my greatest claim to fame). This triggered my love for complex software; my BSc project was a Linux network driver and for MSc thesis I extended a Java virtual machine with additional security measures. I graduated cum laude.
      </p><p>
        After university, I worked as a scientific programmer at my university for a while. I moved on to work on navigation systems and medical devices. Since 2010 I have been working as a free-lancer.
      </p><p>
        I was born in England, but grew up in The Netherlands. I currently live in Helsinki. My clients tend to be based in the EU, but I also have some American clients.
